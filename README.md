# FAIR¬≤ Portal Open Jupyter Notebooks

Welcome to the repository for **Open Jupyter Notebooks** supporting the **FAIR¬≤ Data Packages**. Each notebook provides an example of how to access and analyze the **FAIR¬≤ Data Package** associated with published **Open Data Articles**. These notebooks demonstrate workflows for interacting with FAIR¬≤-compliant datasets, enabling researchers to explore, visualize, and integrate data into their research.

## üìö About FAIR¬≤ Data Packages

**FAIR¬≤ Data Packages** are comprehensive, FAIR-compliant datasets that extend the original FAIR principles by introducing:

- **AI-Readiness**: Optimized datasets for machine learning workflows.
- **Responsible AI Alignment**: Ensuring ethical and transparent data use.
- **Context-Rich Documentation**: Including provenance, methodologies, and detailed descriptions to ensure deep reusability.

These data packages accompany **Open Data Articles** and are designed to make datasets not only findable and reusable but also interpretable and ready for advanced analysis.

## üöÄ Features of the Notebooks

- **Real-World Examples**: Demonstrations of how to access and analyze FAIR¬≤ Data Packages.
- **Reproducible Workflows**: Step-by-step instructions for exploring and processing data.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Dynamic plots and charts to help make sense of the data.
- **Integration Tutorials**: Examples of how to integrate FAIR¬≤ datasets into external tools, APIs, and machine learning workflows.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

Each notebook is stored in a directory that adheres to the following naming convention:

**Author-Year-Short Description**

This structure allows easy identification of the associated Open Data Article.

```plaintext
/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Author-Year-ShortDescription/  # Directory for a specific notebook
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ notebook.ipynb             # The Jupyter Notebook
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                  # Summary of the notebook and related data
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE                    # License for the notebook
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt               # Python dependencies for running notebooks
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                      # This file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE.md                     # License for the repository
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use the notebooks, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (>=3.8)
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/senscience/notebooks.git
   cd notebooks
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Use `pip` to install required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Launch Jupyter:**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   Open the desired notebook file from its corresponding directory to start exploring.

### Running in Google Colab

You can open any notebook directly in **Google Colab** without setting up a local environment.

1. **Locate the Notebook File:**  
   Navigate to the desired `.ipynb` notebook file in the repository on GitHub.

2. **Open in Google Colab:**
   - Click on the notebook file in the GitHub repository.
   - Copy the notebook‚Äôs URL from your browser.
   - Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
   - In Colab, select **File > Open Notebook**.
   - In the pop-up window, go to the **GitHub** tab, paste the notebook's URL, and press **Enter**.
   - Alternatively, you can directly modify the URL to prepend `https://colab.research.google.com/github/`.  
     For example:  
     ```text
     https://colab.research.google.com/github/senscience/notebooks/Author-Year-ShortDescription/notebook.ipynb
     ```

3. **Run the Notebook:**
   - Colab will automatically set up the environment.
   - Follow the instructions in the notebook to access and analyze the associated FAIR¬≤ Data Package.
